\begin{rSection} {Work and Research Experience}
  \begin{rSubsection}{Boston University}{Sep, 2011 - Present}{Research Assistant}{Boston, MA}
    %% \item Thesis: Error Mitigation in ultra-low power digital circuits using feedback systems and dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS)
    %% \item Introduced a novel approach to ultra-low-power equalized computation using pass-transistor logic that allowed for up to 30\% lower energy consumption
    %% \item Developed a novel approach to error mitigation (FEST), tested on Spartan 6 FPGA and taped-out ASIC using GF 130nm technology. Results showed up to 40\% reduction in power dissiption in FIR filters
    %% \item Developed equalized interconnect for manycore systems; ASIC taped-out using UMC 130nm technology
    %% \item Worked on error-correcting codes in sub-micron technology nodes
