  \begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf RISC-V Manycore System Tapeout:} {\it (In progress)} 64-core RISC-V processor using photonic interconnect. Research in progress - tapeout scheduled December 2015 using 40nm process technology.
  \item {\bf "NSFW" Programming Language:} {\it (In progress)} Toy programming language (esoteric) created using Flex, Bison, and LLVM. Currently in progress and is scheduled for August 2015.
  \item {\bf Hardware Background Subtraction DSP using FPGA:} {\it (Complete)} Implemented image background subtraction algorithm on Xilinx Spartan 6 chip (using Verilog HDL). Two step process was developed: dynamic background detection and background subtraction using background filtering.
  \item {\bf Handwriting Calculator using ANN on FPGA:} {\it (Complete)} Using Verilog HDL a hardware ANN was developed and trained to recognize handwritten digits.
  \item {\bf Microstrip PCB 1-GHz Receiver/Transmitter (ASIC/PCB):} {\it (Complete)} Designed using Altium ISE. Design included HF PLL synthesizer, patch antena, RF power amplifier. Testing performed using Agilent instrumentation (oscilloscope, spectrum/network/logic analyzers).
